Maintenance Announcement:

Due to a growth in reports of unauthorized nutrient production, Maintenance would like to remind all citizens of the hazards and consequences of unauthorized nutrient producing facilities and equipment.


Unauthorized nutrient production facilities and equipment consist of but are not limited to the following:

Gardens - Hydroponic, Fungal or Otherwise
Devices Intended to Recapture or Filter Water
Calorie Preserving Pest Traps
Composters
Certain Bacterial Cultures
Pest Breeding “Ranches”

In addition, the following activities are prohibited:

Hunting - Pest, Human or Otherwise
Cultivation of any Nutrient Producing Organism
Fermentation
Distilling of Alcoholic above 1% ABV
Tampering with Maintenance Dispensaries
Tampering with Maintenance Ration Production Facilities or Personnel


The hazards of such production come from the inherent contamination of any nutrients produced using these methods. Maintenance tirelessly works to continually improve nutrient production and safety. No other organization can guarantee or produce safe nutrients due to their lacking of the same proficiencies that only Maintenance can possess. Unauthorized nutrients will cause disease, harm, and other general damage. To help prevent this harm to the community Maintenance has implemented punishments for this destructive behavior.
NOTE: Nutrient preparation facilities and equipment intended for use with authorized nutrients are considered safe.


Maintenance has imposed severe consequences and punishments to limit the harm caused by unauthorized nutrients. Violations of the above prohibitions will result in eviction, conscription to janitorial, reeducation, and or assignment to the concrete mines.


All nutrients must be sourced from Maintenance for community health and safety. To do otherwise is damaging to the community and will be dealt with severely.


Bloc to Prosper,

Maintenance
