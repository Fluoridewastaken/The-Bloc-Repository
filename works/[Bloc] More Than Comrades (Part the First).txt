 Artyom sat in the dirty underbloc bar, taking in the scent of old smoke, fried rat, and alcohol. In his right hand was a can of P96 Dark, and in his left, a photo of his dear Amita. The one that got away –if by got away, one were to imagine someone getting turned into a janitor, and completely forgetting about him. Indeed, they used to raise a lot of hell together, until she got caught by HighSec. Now, he was just a lonely man, with nothing but a few rubits to his name. He drummed his fingers across the bar, trying to think about his next move. He probably couldn’t save her, but damn it if he wouldn’t at least try to love her still. 
 

He finished off his drink, before tossing it to the ground, haphazardly. It was shit, as always, but it really set your mind right. Or wrong. What mattered is that it changed at all, really. He stood up, tossing a few rubits across the bar, before turning around. He suddenly found himself face to face with a big, burly man in a trench coat. His face was entirely concealed- if he even had one. 
 
“Erm... good evening, comrade.” 
 
The trenchcoat beast just stared at him, slowly turning its big, blank head to face him. It was covered in a black mask, which looked a little amusing, but also made Artyom want to shit himself. He tried to walk around it, but found that it moved in the same direction he did, to block his path.
“I don’t like where this is going.” 

Artyom sighed, reaching down to his hip for his gun. 
 
“You owe quite a bit, comrade..” 
 
The trenchoat had already gone for their own piece, which was  along, sharp knife. 
 
“To who?” 
 
Artyom clasped his hand around his zip, cocking it back. 
 
“The Bloc. You’ve been hording, haven’t you? Tsk. Maintenance has no time for divers who won’t pay their dues.” 
 
Artyom scowled. 
 
“There is no maintenance, therefore, nobody to collect dues.” 
 
He suddenly brought the gun up to chest level and shot the trenchcoat five times, in a few swift moves. 
 
“It’s a spook.” 
 
He finished off the trenchcoat with a shot to the head. 
 
“Bloc to Prosper.” 
 
He gave a sly glance to the bartender, before getting his gear back on, and walking out.
