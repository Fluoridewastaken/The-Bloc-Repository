Retirement Lottery

It is with great pleasure that the Retirement Lottery is being implemented. Maintenance has seen and acknowledged all of the hard work that the tenants have done.

Maintenance has authorized a randomized selection program to be implemented in order to pick 3,067 tenants for retirement. You can enter the drawing at your nearest ration dispensary with only the documentation needed to collect rations.

If you are selected, you will be notified by a uniformed collection agent. They will arrive and immediately escort you to the nearest ration production facility for processing.

Once selected, you will never need to worry about housing, consumables, or luxaries. And do not worry responsible citizen, even in retirement you will continue to provide for the Bloc!

Bloc to Prosper,

Tenant Wellness Committee
