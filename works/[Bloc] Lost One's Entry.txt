People like to talk about the ups and the downs – don’t go up there or Maintenance will wipe you from the storybook, don’t go down unless you have a death wish. Everyone talks about the Well, how ominous it is, how tall everything is…

No one ever talks about the lefts and the rights, though. The twists and turns that lead you from room to hallway and from hallway to death. There is so much hidden around these rooms, hatches and ladders that seem to pop up out of nowhere and lead some place special.

It’s insane how many people you will find up there, stashed away like some ancient treasure with their exploited resource keeping them alive, though never sane. Sure there are Shadow Men above and legendary beasts below, but the walls themselves around us house beings and places we’d never even imagine were just around the corner…

The Divers dive, and the idiots climb, but I choose to explore. I choose to walk through crowds instead of water, climb through the mind of the very city we feel is only feel is limitless upwards… I’ve found things I don’t think anyone knows about, I’ve seen places forgotten so long there isn’t anything to remember anymore.

All of it, just around the corner…

Just around the corner…

Just around the corner…

Just around…

Oh no, well-
