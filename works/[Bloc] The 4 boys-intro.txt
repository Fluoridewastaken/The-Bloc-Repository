Narator: 
The day started out like any other for jeremy, being as young as he was (14) he like many others his age attended one of the local lower level placement schools. Schools designed by maint. to train the next generation of workers, maitainers, and various other jobs of The Blocs industry. Though none would ever have a chance at leadership, the only kids eligible have to live in the upper levels. But jeremy paid no attention to those sort of things. He wasn't even interested in leadership and politics anyway. He also didnt have to much care for his schooling he was in either. His current eligible paths were follwing in his fathers steps and a grain marsh farmer, or the various mechanical and construction based roles that lots of hard working members of these level's adults have been doing for generations before. No he wanted something better. He wanted to be one of Bloc's most specialized force. Known by many as the most "badass" and dangerous, some call them crazy, their rarety and elusiveness has granted them a near legendary reputation. They are the "Divers" 
For Jeremy the dream started out as just that. From a young age his father would read him bedtime stories like many other fathers did to their kids when they were young. Filling their heads with the tales of their bravery and how we owe the discovery of the levels we live on now, to them. Most mothers would not approve of their husbands telling their kids these stories. The notion that their precious kids would run off and try to explore the sublevels and inevitably get themselves hurt or killed was aways on their mind.
 Jeremy's mom was no exception. She always yelled at her husband for the stories hed tell jeremy, and she had good reason to worry especially after the incident with the kurtsch family just a level down. The young boy fid kurtsch full of dreams of exploring the sub floors like the great divers, went off on a impromptu trip by himself and never returned.
 That was 10 years ago and their family has never healed. They tried many times to send search parties, but came back with nothing. The event shocked the lower levels. Causing families to be more protective of their young. 
This did not detor jeremy, he has been planning for two years to make a trip of his own. The difference is he and his 3 friends all want to go together, they all have been planning for the right time to go, and today jeremy will be getting the one thing that may secure their safe passage to the sublevels. A map. After school today, jeremy will be meeting with a mysterious person to obtain a map that will help him and his friend reach their goal, the diver's locker. A place where it is rumored that divers hang out. They will venture there, and hopefully learn the ways of divers.
